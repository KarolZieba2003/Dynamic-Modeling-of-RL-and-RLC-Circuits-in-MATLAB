## 🚀 Project Overview

The project consists of two separate MATLAB LiveScript files where both are a relatively simple time domain system analysis. 
The first script is dedicated to the first-order (RL) and the second to the second-order (RLC) electrical circuits. 
Both scripts use the MATLAB Symbolic Math Toolbox addon to analytically solve the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that determine the response of the electrical circuit. 

The primary goal is to understand and visualize the transient response of these circuits by analyzing the impact of different parameters, such as initial conditions, input voltage, and component values (L, C).

This project was a laboratory assignment for the "Dynamic Systems Modeling" course at the Cracow University of Technology.

## ⚡ Key Features

Both scripts use `dsolve` to find the exact analytical formulas for current $i(t)$ and capacitor voltage $u_c(t)$, 
then they generate plots showing the time-based response for various scenarios (e.g., $i(t)$ , $u_c(t)$).
The first file shows that in every RL circuit (and in every first order circuit) the time needed for the system to reach the steady state conditions is approximately five time constants $\tau$ where the second file which analyses an RLC circuit generates phase plots (e.g., $i$ vs. $di/dt$) to visualize the system's dynamics and stability.

## 📊 Sample Results

Here are some examples of the plots generated by the scripts.

### Exercise 1: RL Circuit (1st Order System)

Analyzes the current decay based on different initial conditions $i(0)$, the system's response to a step input $u_0$ and the influence of the time constant $\tau = L/R$$.

### Exercise 2: RLC Circuit (2nd Order System)

Analyzes the impact of component values ($C$) on the system's damping. The plots below show the difference between an underdamped and a critically damped system.

| Underdamped (C < C_crit) | Critically Damped (C = C_crit) |

## 🔧 How to Use

1.  **Prerequisites:** You must have MATLAB and the **Symbolic Math Toolbox** installed.
2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/TWOJA-NAZWA-UZYTKOWNIKA/TWOJA-NAZWA-REPO.git](https://github.com/TWOJA-NAZWA-UZYTKOWNIKA/TWOJA-NAZWA-REPO.git)
    ```
3.  **Run the script:**
    * Open `CW1.m` (for the RL circuit analysis) or `CW2.m` (for the RLC circuit analysis).
    * Inside the script, **uncomment** the "Case" (Przypadek 1, 2, or 3) you wish to run.
    * Run the script (F5). The script will output the analytical solutions to the console and generate the plots.
